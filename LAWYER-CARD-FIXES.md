# ✅ Lawyer Card Dynamic Data Fixes

## Issue Fixed
The lawyer cards were showing hardcoded "Attorney Wieczorek" instead of displaying actual lawyer names from the database records.

## Changes Made

### 1. **AttorneyCard Component (`src/components/AttorneyCard/AttorneyCard.tsx`)**

**Fixed Hardcoded Text:**
- ❌ **Before:** "Meet Attorney Wieczorek and learn about his approach to criminal defense cases."  
- ✅ **After:** "Meet {attorneyName} and learn about their approach to legal cases."

**Updated Default Values:**
- ❌ **Before:** `firmName = "THE WIECZOREK LAW FIRM"`  
- ✅ **After:** `firmName = "LEGAL SERVICES FIRM"`

- ❌ **Before:** Description referenced "Wieczorek Law Firm" specifically  
- ✅ **After:** Generic description that works for any law firm

**Fixed Review Comments:**
- ❌ **Before:** "Attorney Wieczorek was amazing throughout my entire case..."  
- ✅ **After:** "This attorney was amazing throughout my entire case..."

### 2. **LawyerPreviewCard Component (`src/components/LawyerPreviewCard/LawyerPreviewCard.tsx`)**

**Updated Default Name:**
- ❌ **Before:** `name = "Attorney Wieczorek"`  
- ✅ **After:** `name = "Attorney Representative"`

## How Dynamic Data Works

### **Name Extraction Logic:**
The system automatically extracts attorney names from the law firm names in the database:

```typescript
// Examples of name extraction:
"Law Offices of John Smith" → "John Smith"
"Smith & Associates" → "Smith"  
"Johnson Law Firm" → "Johnson"
"Generic Law Firm" → "Generic"
```

### **Data Flow:**
1. **Database** → Contains law firm names in `lawyers_real` table
2. **Lawyer Service** → Extracts attorney names using smart parsing
3. **Modal/Components** → Pass `lawyer.name` to `attorneyName` prop
4. **Attorney Card** → Displays actual lawyer name dynamically

## Verification

✅ **No more hardcoded "Wieczorek" references**  
✅ **Cards show actual lawyer names from database**  
✅ **Fallback to generic placeholders when needed**  
✅ **Consistent across all lawyer card components**

## What You'll See Now

- **Allen County lawyers** will show actual firm partner names
- **Video section** will say "Meet [Actual Attorney Name]"  
- **Default cards** use generic "Attorney Representative" instead of "Wieczorek"
- **All text dynamically adapts** to the specific lawyer being displayed

The lawyer cards now properly reflect the actual legal professionals in your database rather than placeholder content!
