The AI-powered conversational lawyer search system has been successfully implemented and thoroughly tested. All core features are working as expected.

## ðŸš€ Key Features Delivered

Enhanced: "I need a lawyer in Los Angelos for a car accident [LOCATION: Los Angeles, California] [CASE_TYPE: personal_injury]"
System: Typo corrected, case type detected, fuzzy matched to database
```

### Progressive Conversation
```
User: "I was in a car accident"
State: { caseType: "personal_injury" }

User: "It happened in Orange County" 
State: { caseType: "personal_injury", county: "Orange County" }

User: "In California"
State: { caseType: "personal_injury", county: "Orange County", state: "California" }
â†’ Ready to search lawyers
```
